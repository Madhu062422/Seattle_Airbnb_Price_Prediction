# Seattle_Airbnb_Price_Prediction

The objective of the project to to analyse Seattle AirBnb dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?resource=download using
CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which consists of the following steps:

*   Business Understanding
*   Data Understanding
*   Prepare Data
*   Data Modeling
*   Evaluation

In this project we will be performing anlysis on the data to visualise how these data could be used and answer the below questions such as,
*   Which are the busiest or most popular time of the year to rent?
*   Which is the most expensive month for listings?
*   How are the prices varying across all neighbourgood in Seattle?
*   Which features influence the most in determining the price of a listing? How can we model this?
    
Along with the above listed objectives, we will try to cover other questions such as what are the most expensive time of the year to rent, how many listings are published month wise, etc.

We have wrangled the data to get the relevant features from calender.csv and listings.csv and build some linear models and a Random Forest model. We have predicted the prices using Random Forest Model
